**Natural Language Terminal** is an innovative command-line interface (CLI) powered by advanced AI, designed to interpret and execute commands efficiently through natural language prompts. Created by **Sean** from **[Vector Index](https://vectorindex.cloud)**, this tool merges the simplicity of conversational AI with the powerful functionality of traditional CLIs.

Inspired by the open-source AI project [Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor](https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor), Natural Language Terminal aims to bridge the gap between technical users and intuitive command execution.
